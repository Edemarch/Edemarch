👋 Hello! I'm Emmanuel Demarch

I'm a Process Improvement and Data Analysis enthusiast with a passion for exploring time series, data analysis, and linear programming. My diverse background in banks, multinational companies, consultancies, and smaller firms has equipped me with a solid foundation in process optimization, data analytics, and operational research.

💡 What I Do:

Process Improvement: Recognized for leading impactful projects, including an award-winning reverse logistics process that reduced inventory by 50% and saved over 2 million BRL in a year.
Data Analysis: Skilled in using Python, SQL, Excel, and Google Sheets (AppScript) for data analysis and automation. I’ve created dashboards with Looker, Google Sheets, and Power BI, and have experience in developing solutions with C# and Python.
Optimization & Linear Programming: With a professional master’s degree in operations research, I specialize in linear programming and optimization using tools like Gurobi, OR-Tools, and Pyomo.

📊 GitHub Projects:

I'm excited to share my work on time series analysis, data visualization, and optimization models. My repositories will feature projects that showcase my skills in linear programming, data-driven decision making, and automation.

When I’m not diving into data, you can find me exploring new places, playing soccer, reading, or working on self-development. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy taking on new challenges that push me to grow both personally and professionally.
